                A lavra is a senior monastery, while pecherska means 'of the caves'.
                The Greek St Antony founded this lavra in 1051, after Orthodoxy was adopted as Kyivan Rus' official religion.
                He and his follower Feodosy progressively dug out a series of catacombs,
                where they and other reclusive monks worshipped, studied and lived.
                When they died their bodies were naturally preserved, without embalming, by the caves'
                cool temperature and dry atmosphere. The mummies survive even today, confirmation for believers that these were true holy men.

            <p>
                The symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a famous landmark.
                This structure of 8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary exhibit for the World Fair of 1889.
                Originally loathed by critics, the 320-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable fixture of the Paris skyline.
                The Eiffel Tower's gracefulness has earned it the nickname of "Iron Lady."
                Visitors are impressed by the tower's delicate airiness despite its monumental size and the breathtaking panoramas at each of the three levels.

                In a stately palace that was once a royal residence, the Louvre Museum ranks among the top European collections of fine arts.
                Many of Western Civilization's most famous works are found here, including the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci,
                the Wedding Feast at Cana by Veronese, and the 1st-century-BC Venus de Milo sculpture.
                The collection owes its wealth to the contributions of various kings who lived in the Louvre.
                Other pieces were added as a result of France's treaties with the Vatican and the Republic of Venice, and from the spoils of Napoléon I.

                This UNESCO-listed monument represents a glorious moment of France's history, under the reign of Louis XIV (known as the "Sun King"),
                when the palace set the standard for princely courts in Europe.
                Beginning in 1661, Louis XIV transformed his father's hunting lodge (a small château) into an opulent royal palace.
                To realize the vision of Louis XIV, esteemed architect Louis Le Vau renovated the château of Louis XIII in an elegant neoclassical manner.
